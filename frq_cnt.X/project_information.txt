Counts a frequency from 7000.0 to 7200.0 kHz with 100Hz resolution.
(Counter works from 6328.2kHz to 9999.9kHz but with less accuracy).
Result is available as CW signal.
Additional switch input for -700Hz shift.


Hardware:
PIC10F322
Connect a 1MHz reference oscillator to PIN RA2 (T0CKI)
Connect the LO signal to RA1 (CLKIN)
The audio signal is available on RA0
Switch RA3 to GND to add an offset of -700Hz

IDE: MPLAB X ID v3.55
MPLAB XC8 C Compiler (Free Mode) V1.30
